        they generate in the exercise of their functions to be used by citizens to generate new knowledge, services or
        entrepreneurship.")}}</p>
    <h3>{{_("Open data in the National Library of Spain")}}</h3>

    <p>{{_("The Biblioteca Nacional de España massively generates standardized, interoperable and standardized data: its
        bibliographic and authority catalogs are its main tool and source of information, and the BNE has been making
        them available for download under open and reusable licenses for years. It also maintains and publishes
        standardized vocabularies, statistics, bibliography, directories... or the texts derived from the digitization
        processes of its collections.")}}</p>

    <p>{{_("Since 2015, the Biblioteca Nacional de España has included among its strategic lines the promotion of the reuse
        of its data. As part of the BNElab project, all the open data files generated by the BNE were analyzed,
        segmented and converted to open and reusable formats such as JSON, CSV, TXT, ODS and XML, and published on
        datos.gob, while a line of collaboration with communities of potential reusers was initiated to promote the use
        of these datasets in all possible sectors (natural language processing, digital humanities, tourism, artificial
        intelligence, big data...")}}</p>

    <p>{{_("With this new data portal, the Biblioteca Nacional de España is taking another step forward in promoting the use
        of its digital resources, expanding the possibilities for access, exploitation and exchange with reusers. This
        is a project under construction, in which services and functionalities will be gradually added. We count on your
        collaboration!")}}</p>

    <h1>{{_("What is a dataset?")}}</h1>

    <p>{{_("It is a collection of related data that can be reused (either on its own or mixed with other data) to create

            terms of use, which are always oriented to its reuse.")}}</li>

    <p>{{_("The data portal offers information for different reuser profiles (programmers or advanced reusers,
        journalists, researchers, general public, etc.). Therefore, the data is displayed in different formats,
        which serve different uses and needs and require different levels of knowledge and handling of these
        large data files.")}}</p>

    <p>{{_("All the large datasets generated by the BNE in the exercise of its functions have been selected (mainly
        those of the bibliographic catalog and authorities, but also other types of data, such as vocabularies,
        web collection data, bibliography...), and we have treated them to make them more easily accessible and
        workable. We are still in the process of adding new sets, contact BNElab if you have any proposals!")}}</p>
